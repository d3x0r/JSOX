# Changelog Previous

Latest changelog entries in [Readme link](README.md#Changelog)

- 1.2.114
    - import.mjs is not included in npm publish (fixed)
    - Fix errors found when reviving referneces; (assumed a field in object meant THE object; checked wrong array length; cleanup duplicate variables)
- 1.2.113
    - Add higher resolution Date type called DateNS; which adds a 'ns' field which is a number of additional nanoseconds on top of the timestamp.  (JS Specific issue; ISO-8601 date format may be of any precision)
- 1.2.112
    - add check for `\ufeff` in stringifier for identifiers; because of BOM legacy usage unquoted ZWNBSP has to be counted as just whitespace. (especially considering multiple files might have been concatenated?)
- 1.2.111
    - fixes travis tests; latest mocha/coverage slows benchmark tests by 10x.
- 1.2.110
    - Fix packaging error.
- 1.2.109
    - fixed vertical tab character parsing.
    - fixed hex numbers with `[a-f][A-F]` characters.
    - added reset() method for tests to reset global JSOX type registrations.
    - added 1.2.108 named tests.
    - Added `RegExp` support; ~~encodes as `?e?` string type;  `JSOX.parses("?e?'a+'") === /a+/`~~
       - encode as `regex` instead of `?e?`; is actually 1 byte shorter, and more familiar. `JSOX.parses("regex'a+'") === /a+/`, `JSOX.stringify(/a+/) === /"regex'a+'"/`
- 1.2.108
    - Refix base64, which failed to quote strings that looked like numbers.
    - Clear array buffer typed variable when resolving the typed array; leaked to next parse.
- 1.2.107
    - Updated document about CI tests.
    - Enable Travis CI integration.
    - Reference arrays don't result with the same object; reduce frequency of warning message.
    - Remove automatic guess promoting numbers to bigints, floats can also be pretty big.
- 1.2.106
    - fix regression in stringifying binary array objects; removing the quotes caused the '/' to be interpreted as a comment.
    - update documentation about base64 encoding
    - replace '+/' with '$_' as the high value strings emitted.  Older versions will already accept this encoding.
- 1.2.105
    - Fix losing array containing typed objects.
    - Pass stringifier to toJSOX method.
    - Added compatibility tests between sack.vfs node plugin and JS version.
    - Fixed issues reviving references (new test), and replacing/providing values.
- 1.2.104
    - Throw error while parser is in error state and new writes() are called.
    - allow '+' prefix to numbers
    - Fix fromJSOX class revival handling; call per-field.
    - Added beginning of stringify tests (coverage).
- 1.2.103
    - additional reference path revival fix.
- 1.2.102
    - added automated test notes
    - Added formal reference revival test; a different recursive variation of reference which failed.
    - refactored to remove 'element_array' special case tracking variable; standardize on just 'elements' instead.
- 1.1.123 (published as 1.2.101)
    - Added automated mocha tests; (ported from JSON6).
    - Fixed some parsing issues exposed by tests around unicode whitespace handling and more.  
    - Throw an error when a invalid date is created.
    - Most fixes were in handling badly formatted data either with exceptions, or accepting more badly formatted input as valid.
- 1.1.122
    - Remove option SUPPORT_LEAD_ZERO_OCTAL; JS "strict" errors on lead zeros; and Number() converts lead zeros as decimal; removes custom decoding.
- 1.1.121
    - fix parsing {op:f,}.  Generalize unquoted string recovery.
- 1.1.120
    - revert UTC time change; keep accuracy.
- 1.1.119
    - missed the toFullYear -> toUTCFullYear of the date.
- 1.1.118
    - treat \u00A0 the same as a ' ' (space).  Visually they are the same, so in the interst of being human readable, it would make sense the machine should read it the same way.
    - fix failure to encode millisecond into timestamp.
- 1.1.117
    - Fixes reviving a class in a class in a map referencing the class in the map, and then finishsing map.class.class before finishing map.class 
    - Fixes reviving references after another prototype revival.  (map followed by a key with a reference).
    - restore handling empty object arguments `{,,a:3,,,,,b:4,,,}` results in `{a;3,b:4}`.
    - Added some tests which caused the above failures; updated ancient tests to account for 
    - top level `<string><object>` in a stream to seprate with `<string><ws><object>` which is valid for the test.
- 1.1.116
    - Provides 'browser', and 'module' entry points.  Improves module support.
    - Fixes an issue with references in arrays after other objects.
    - Fixes unclosed ref array state, for `ref[], []`.
    - Resolves an internal state meaning that overlapped meaning of default and pushed.
- 1.1.115
    - publish minor doc updates
- 1.1.114
    - Cricial Fix - clear arrayType when opening a new object or array (circular object decode)
    - Reference fix when referencing the root node.
- 1.1.113
    - fix leftover test code in require.js.
- 1.1.111
    - fix packaging.
- 1.1.101
    - Minor patch to get a long miner version
    - fixed base64 decoding to handle terminations better.
- 1.1.1
    - added Map() builtin type for JS which is type 'map'.
    - Fixed expression which quoted words with 'S' or 's' in them.
    - Fixed Known array types.
- 1.1.0 
    - Added stringifier/parser instance specific registrations for ToJSOX and FromJSOX handlers.
    - removed unicode non-identifier check, prefering instead just the set of structure characters (basically anything which is not caught before the end begins an identifier).  This simplifies testing field names for encoding/stringification.
- 1.0.8 - Sort object fields case insensitively; standardize field ordering.
- 1.0.7 - Fixed some stream parsing issues with identifiers.
- 1.0.6 - just updated build products
- 1.0.5 
    - Fix streaming ability
    - consequtive strings only have whitespace to separate them, so identifiers for defining typed-objects cannot have whitespace between them and '{'.
    - (reverted)implement test for non-identifier characters to quote field strings (or not).  Implement reading non-identifier characters, and fault if identifier is unquoted and has such a character.
    - implement typed-strings, which can be used to trigger constructors which accept single strings.
    - update readme with typed-strings, typed-arrays, and typed-objects.
    - performance fix; was keeping parser objects forever.
- 1.0.4 - Be more forgiving about platforms not having BigInt native support.
- 1.0.3 - Add ability to register prototypes to use for decoding.
- 1.0.2 - Issue with mutiple leading and trailing spaces. Fix collecting streams of numbers.  Fix an issue with nested classes.  Add circular reference support.
- 1.0.1 - Removed modification of object prototypes; instead track object prototype to formatting function in a WeakMap().  Fixed class expansion.  Make objects of a class share the same prototype.
- 1.0.0 - Intial Release.
